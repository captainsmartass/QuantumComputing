function [Fidelity] = Fidelity(rho_1,rho_2);
%rho_1 should be chosen such that the square roots of its eigenvalues are
%positive semidefinite. The calculation of fidelity here is straightforward 
%upon viewing the equation.
c = sqrtm(rho_1);
if size(rho_1) == size(rho_2)
    
    Fidelity = trace(sqrtm(c*rho_2*c));
else
    fprintf('Enter density matrices of same state space')
